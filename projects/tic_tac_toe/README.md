# Tic-Tac-Toe in C

A classic 2-player console game.

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. The grid cells are numbered 1 to 9.
3. Player X goes first.
4. Players take turns choosing a number to place their mark (X or O).
5. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
6. If all 9 squares are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
